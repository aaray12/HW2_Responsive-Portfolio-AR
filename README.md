# HW2_Responsive-Portfolio-AR
A responsive portfolio about myself.

Portfolio has three main pages.

1) an "About Me" page where I give a short description about myself.

2) A "Portfolio" page, wherer I share pictures I have takem.

3) A "Message" page where users could potentially send me a message.

The pages are set up so that they are responsive and you can link to them easily through the navbar. 
I mainly used bootstrap for this project.
